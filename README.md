Requires a copy of Crypt of the NecroDancer.

## Features

### Done
* Level rendering
* Dungeon loading
* Dungeon saving
* Basic brush tools (place/erase objects and tiles)

### In progress
* Level management (select, add, remove, arrange)
* Level properties (music, boss, player spawn point)

### TODO
* Fix save action (currently aliased to "save as")
* Remove "window-in-window"
* Better object placement (object stacking, removing topmost object only, etc.)
* Object properties when placing (position, type, enemy beat delay, chest content, etc.)
* Selection tool
* Picking for brush tools (select tile hovered by mouse cursor)
* More brush shapes (line, rectangle)
* Customizable keyboard and mouse controls
* Undo/Redo

### Future ideas
* Extra tools for specific tasks (e.g. bouncetrap chains)
* "Test level" button (requires API from NecroDancer)
* Networking (multi-user realtime editing)
